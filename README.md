Hello, my name is Padraic Flynn. I am currently a respiratory therapist who is enrolled in Promineo Tech's back-end coding boot camp. I have pinned some good examples of what I've been working on and learning. As I keep learning and practicing I will add code here, but will only pin bigger projects. 

My ultimate goal is making a career change. The past few years have seen a lot of changes working at the bedside with patients. I'm proud of the work and help I've provided patients and am looking forward to learning and growing in a new direction. I'm excited to explore opportunities where I can apply my skills as a programmer and my unique perspective and experiences as a healthcare provider. 
 
 Some of my favorite hobbies include board games, video games, tabletop games, and trading card games. A future personal goal would be to design and build my own digital board game.
